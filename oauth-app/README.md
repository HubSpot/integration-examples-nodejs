# HubSpot-nodejs oauth sample app

This is a sample app for the [node-hubspot wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubspot). Currently, this app focuses on demonstrating the functionality of [OAuth API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/oauth2/oauth2-overview) endpoints and their related actions.

  - [Using OAuth 2.0 access tokens](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/oauth2/get-access-and-refresh-tokens)
  - [Get all contacts](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/contacts/get_contacts)

Please see the documentation on [How do I create an app in HubSpot?](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/faq/how-do-i-create-an-app-in-hubspot)

### Setup App

Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
Make sure you have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

### Note on Application Scopes
HubSpot provides a way to restrict application users access to the system to certain scopes. In order to do that it is a good practice to make a set of scopes required by your applicatuion.
Please refer to [Initiate an Integration with OAuth 2.0](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/oauth2/initiate-oauth-integration) for documentation on the scope parameter passed to https://app.hubspot.com/oauth/authorize to make a set of scopes required. [Scopes](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/oauth2/initiate-oauth-integration#scopes) explains how to make optional scopes and talks about scopes available in HubSpot system 

### Configure

1. Copy .env.template to .env
2. Paste your HubSpot Client Id and HubSpot Client Secret as the value for HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID and HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET in .env

### Running

The best way to run this project (with the least configuration), is using docker cli.

```bash
docker-compose up 
```
You should now be able to navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and use the application.
